[![Build APK](https://github.com/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient/actions/workflows/build-apk.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient/actions/workflows/build-apk.yml)[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient.svg)](https://github.com/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient/issues)[![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-3DDC84?logo=android&logoColor=white)](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Neon Purple Edition

This is a fully rebranded build: every trace of the original name has been replaced with
**Vortex / Vortex Client**, the launcher icon and in-app logo use the new Vortex mark, and
the complete UI (Material3 theme, splash screen, KitsuGUI, ClickGUI, Wraith client,
overlays, minimap, notifications and every accent colour) has been repainted in
**neon purple** — `#B026FF` primary, `#C77DFF` / `#E455FF` accents on a deep `#0A0611` base.

---

## Community

Questions, bug reports and feature ideas are welcome on the
[GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient/issues). The upstream Lumina community
lives in the [Project Lumina Discord](https://discord.gg/78bqDpAHmK), which is still the
best place for help with the underlying client features.

---

## System Requirements

To run Vortex Client, your device must meet the following specifications:

- **Android**: Android 9.0 (Pie) or later, supporting both 64-bit and 32-bit architectures.
- **Minecraft Version**: Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.21.80 or later is recommended for optimal performance and compatibility.
- **Non-Android Platforms**: For PC, Mac, or other devices, Vortex operates remotely through an Android device running the client.
- **Storage**: At least 200 MB of free storage for the APK and associated data.
- **Internet**: A stable internet connection is recommended, especially for multiplayer servers.

No additional hardware is required, but enabling developer options on Android may improve the installation process.

---

## Installation Instructions

Setting up Vortex Client is quick and straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the APK**: Head to our [Releases page](https://github.com/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient/releases) and download the latest Vortex Client APK.
2. **Allow Unknown Sources**: On your Android device, go to **Settings > Security** (or **Apps & Notifications** on newer versions) and enable **Install from Unknown Sources**.
3. **Install the APK**: Open the downloaded APK file using a file manager, tap to install, and follow the prompts.
4. **Launch Vortex**: Find Vortex in your app drawer, open it, and log in with your Minecraft account.
5. **Configure Settings**: Adjust keybinds, enable desired tools, and customize the UI to suit your preferences.
6. **Test on a Server**: Join a test server to ensure everything works as expected. For best results, start with a non-protected server to familiarize yourself with the features.

If you encounter issues, open an [issue](https://github.com/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient/issues) or consult the [NOTICE](https://github.com/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient/blob/main/NOTICE) file.

## Development Setup

For developers looking to contribute or customize Vortex, here’s how to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient.git
    ```

   This downloads the full source code to your local machine.

2. **Open in Android Studio**:

   - Launch Android Studio and select **Open an existing project**.
   - Choose the `ShadowClient` directory and open it.
3. **Replace google-services.json**:

   - The repository includes a dummy `google-services.json` file, which must be replaced with your own for the app to build successfully.
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Add an Android app to your Firebase project, following the prompts to download your `google-services.json` file.
   - Place the downloaded `google-services.json` file in the `app` directory of the VortexClient project, overwriting the dummy file.
   - Ensure the package name in Firebase matches the one in `build.gradle` (e.g., `com.project.vortex.client`).
4. **Sync Gradle**:

   - Click **Sync Project with Gradle Files** to fetch dependencies.
   - Ensure you have the Android SDK (API level 28 or higher) and Gradle installed.
5. **Build and Test**:

   - Connect an Android device or configure an emulator.
   - Select **Run > Run 'app'** to build and deploy Vortex.
   - Test changes on a local Minecraft Bedrock server to verify functionality.

Refer to inline comments and the [NOTICE](https://github.com/demoneditz985-ctrl/ShadowClient/blob/main/NOTICE) file for guidance. The upstream project is documented at [TheProjectLumina/LuminaClient](https://github.com/TheProjectLumina/LuminaClient).
